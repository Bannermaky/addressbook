1. Build out the address class.  
From class you should already have a stub of a file with the following structure:

--2 import statements
--class header
--field declarations for friends and numFriends

Also,
--Constructor for AddressBook of 10 friends
--Add contact method
--PrintCOntacts Method

Now - the following steps will help you build out the rest of the address class.

1. create a method numContacts to return number of friends currently in the address book
      as this is an accessor method, it should return an int.
      
2. create a method haveContact.  It should return a non-negative integer if a contact with name s
exists, corresponding to which the place in the array 'friends' in the Contact is stored.  
Method shouldaccept a string s and return an integer after searches through the array of friends 
HINT:  Use the getName method, otherwise, return -1 .

3.  write a method Delete contact that accepts a string s and finds the contact position in
the friends array using the haveContact method.  If the contact is there, haveContact will return the position,
otherwise return -1.  swap the last contact in the friends array into the dound position, and shorten numfriends by one.

4. create a main method to create a new instance of a scanner, call a menu method that prints out a list of
"menu" options, and based on the choice, add contact, delete contact, print num of contact, print all contacts, or quit.

5. immediately following the call to menu method, take an int variable as the users choice, thenuse ifs or select case to manage the user choice

6. if new contact, prompt for and save: name, age, phone num (watch format), and birthday, (month, and then year)

7. menu method can be pub stat void menu and just a series of println formatted niceley.
